### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

VPC allows us to build a virtual network at the location that we define. Create a VPC would be a critical step to launch a secure web application. VPC is built on the idea of traditional network of data center with the ability to scale up in a second without invest large capital

One of the important note when building a VPC is to make ensure accessibility. To do so, we need to span VPC on more than one Availibility Zones. Also, we need both public subnet and private subnet to maintain a secure network

### Create VPC on AWS

To create a VPC, we can go to AWS Management Console and search for `vpc`

When create a VPC, it always come with VPC name, Availability Zone, Public subnet, private subnet...

To place VPC on multiple Availability Zones, we need to create additional subnet (each subnet comes with a private and public subnet)

You can configure subnet address by editing *CIDR Block*
