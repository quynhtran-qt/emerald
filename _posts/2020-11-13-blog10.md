### PCAP file and TCPreplay

what is a Pcap file? A pcap file collect and record packet data from a network. Pcap file can be very dangerous if used by hackers. They can collect your personal information as long as banking account and other private data that your device use to communicate on the internet

Today, I want to talk about Pcap file and **tcpreplay**  - a small utility open source program designed to replaying previous captured network traffic. Tcpreplay will run the pcap file

### How to get Pcap file

For practice purposes, you can find many pcap file example on the internet, one good source can be found [here](https://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles)

### How to install TCPreplay on Mac

Tcpreplay can be installed using homebrew

`brew install tcpreplay`

The other way to install Tcpreplay incase you do not have homebrew installed on your device

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null`

An example of tcpreplay command

>tcpreplay -i eth7 -tK --loop 5000 --unique-ip smallFlows.pcap

where -i is a flag for the interface
      -t: replay packet as fast as possible
      -K: reload packet into Ram before sending
      --loop: loop thru the pcap file 5000 time
      --unique-ip: Modify IP addresses each loop iteration to generate unique flows
