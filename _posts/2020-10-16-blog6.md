Today, we will discuss about python script, one of the most popular language used in modern technology. 

##### How to start python shell in MACOS

MacOS is usually come with python in its system. All we need to do is upgrade the current python to the lastest version in case we want to use all the new configuration may come with it

> First thing though, you have to make sure you install **homebrew** which is already discussed in [blog-0](https://quynhtran-qt.github.io/emerald//blog-0)


First, check what python's version we are currently on, then upgrade the current python to python3

{% highlight homebrew linenos %}

brew info python
brew update && brew upgrade python

{% endhighlight %}

Then you want to point to the newly installed python version

{% highlight homebrew linenos %}

alias python=/usr/local/bin/python3

{% endhighlight %}

Now you are ready to run the newest Python version

To start the python shell you just need to type `python3` in your terminal

To exit python shell, just type `exit()`

![exit-shell](/emerald/img/python-shell.png "exit python shell")

You can also write python script using your text editor and run the script in terminal

` python3 filename.py`
