### Let's learn about binary and hexadecimal today

#### What is binary

Binary number are the term use in machine language. Binary number only has two values 1 and 0. Each digit can only represent 1 value, either True (1) or False (0). Even though this language only has two values, but it the only thing machine understand and perform all kind of technologies we have been using today.

### How to converse binary to decimal number

If binary is the value machine understands, decimal number is what we human can easily read and understand. Comparing to binary, decimal has more unique values, from 0-9

Here is an example of a binary number: 1000

The equivalent to this number in decimal is 8

A binary number can have maximum 8 bits, each bit position can be convert to decimal number by 2 to the power of the position of the bit (2<sup>position</sup>)

| Binary      | 1   | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Postion     | 8   | 7  | 6  | 5  | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Decimal val | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

Let's calculate the binary: 1000

| Binary   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Position | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| Dec Val  | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

> Decimal  = 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8

> 1000 = 8
