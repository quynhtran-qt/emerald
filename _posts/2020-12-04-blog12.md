### Working with IPTABLE in LINUX

### What is Iptables

In Linux, Iptables is an interface of netfilter, which can be used to create custom firewall rules. User can decide what to to with a packet from accept it, drop it or forward it to another device. 

### Basic commands in iptables

1. To list all the current traffic of the firewall


`iptables -L`


The command above, by default, will show the default setting of iptables.


2. To add new rules, there are a few action we can take. To add rules to an incoming traffic


`iptables -A "target-chain" `


-A: an option to add new rule to a certain target chain: these are INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD


3. To accept/drop/reject a packet 


`iptables -A 'INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD' -j 'DROP/ACCEPT/REJECT'


4. To log activities of the firewall


`iptables -A 'target-chain' -j LOG


-j: jump  - specify target of the rules. For instance, if we want to log activities of the firewall under the name "my-firewall-activity", we can use below commands

`iptables -A "target-chain" -j my-firewall-activity
