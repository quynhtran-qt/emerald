### Deploy AWS Lamda using Terraform

Lamda function is a compute service that can help us run code without managing server. Lamda can run code only when needed and can be scaled automatically. We just need to pay when the lamda function is in action, and no extra charge if the code just sit back in our storage. 

Terraform can deploy Lamda function 

### Create IAM Role

First, we need to create IAM role to manage all IAM related stuff

In the same directory as Lamda function, we can create a new terraform file, using terraform IAM code from terraform resources *(lookup aws_iam_role_policy)*

`
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "test_policy" {
  name = "test_policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.test_role.id

  # Terraform's "jsonencode" function converts a
  # Terraform expression result to valid JSON syntax.
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "test_role" {
  name = "test_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}
