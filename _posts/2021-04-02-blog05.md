### Terraform use case

Terraform can be used to setup your infrastructure the way you want. It can be used to setup cluster of nodes in a smaller amount of time than doing it manually which is time consuming. Once you write down terraform templates you can run it to setup the nodes instantly. The greatest advantage of using Terraform is that it supports various cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Openstack etc and it is open source.

### Terraform: API

Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.
