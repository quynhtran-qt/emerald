### How to work with Pep9

Pep9 is a assembler and stimulator explain the simplest level of machine learning. Working with Pep9 will give you a better understanding about how data stored in memory and and machine understand instruction and commands.

### Some example 

Let's get started by looking at some example

Question: Write a Pep/9 assembler program to add an array of 8-bit numbers using indexed addressing. Use the following numbers: 0x24, 0x56, 0x11, 0x03, 0x84, 0x77, and 0xE2. (Increment the index register by adding 1). Take a screenshot after the run; label it Lb3PtA1. Then step thru the program and identify each time a carry or an overflow occurs. Take a screenshot of each instance and label them Lb3PtA2, Lb3PtA3, etc., as needed).

this is what it look like in Pep9
